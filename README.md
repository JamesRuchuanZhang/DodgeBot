The objective of this project was to find a better way to address matchmaking and prevent LP losses from poorly matched games.

In order to run these notebooks, you will need a "keys.txt" text file that contains a valid Riot Games API key on the first line and a "igns.txt" text file that contains a list of in-game names that were volunteered to be used as training data.
